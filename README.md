# Crash Course Repo

This is a repo containing the Crash Course Unity project created by Ansh (SIGGD Programming Lead) in an in-person demonstration at a club meeting.

### How to use this repo?
You can view the files of the project directly in GitHub web (without cloning or forking the repo).

Alternatively, if you wish to view the project within Unity, you will probably need to 1) fork the repo (create your own repo that is a copy of my repo), 2) clone your fork onto your local computer, and 3) locate / open the project through Unity Hub (remember, Unity editor version 2022.3.45f1)
